Me am not Bizarro Riley. You should not read this. Coding is bad.

Instructor: Riley John Gibbs

Course information available on the Crossroads website.

Files (mostly code) relevant to this course will be uploaded to this repository. Anyone should be able to clone (download) this repo and pull from it. The easiest way to do that would be either to use Xcode's Source Control feature to clone by URL, or to use [Github's desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) to do the same.
